## Description  
This Python program **College Freshman Simulator** serves as a **College Life Adventure Game** for an incoming freshman student. **College Freshman Simulator** is based on the decisions you make throughout the college semester, and finally ending with your final semester outcome.
The endings that’re received originate from the choices you’ve made throughout the academic semester.  
The program demonstrates **branching concepts** such as:  
- If/ Elif/ Else statements (Step 2)
- Nested If statements  (Step 2)
- Comparison operators   (Step 2 and 3)
- Membership operators  (Step 3)
- Logical operators  (Step 3)
- Identity operators (Step 4)
- Branching outcomes  (Step 4)

## Endings  
- **Ending 1**: This ending occurs when the student performs spectacularly in there academics and keeps a good mental state in the process of it.  
- **Ending 2**: This ending occurs when the student performs spectacularly, but at a cost of their mental health. So they are insisted to award themself something to compensate.  
- **Ending 3**: This ending occurs when the student performs on an average scale; they received grades that were on pair with the majority of their peers.  
- **Ending 4**: This ending occurs when the student performs on an average scale, however their social skills suffered later down the line of the journey.  
- **Ending 5**: This ending occurs when the student performs horribly and receives academic probation. Now they have to stategize how they will pull themself back up to a good academic standing once taken off probation.
